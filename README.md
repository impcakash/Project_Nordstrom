<h2>About Project</h2>
<p>
    This Project was assigned to us during our construct week in 2nd unit at Masai School. The Project is about to clone the NordStorm shopping site. "NordStorm" is an American luxury department store chain, that specializes in manufacturing and selling urban-style clothing and accessories. The brand uses the US popular culture in its product design.

<h2>Technologies used in Project</h2>
<p>
    We used various technologies in our Project. We used HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT for the basic structure of our website. We also used LOCALSTORAGE on our website to transfer the data from one page to another page.
</p>

<h2>Components</h2>
<p>
    If anyone visits our site, first of all, you get the home page where you can choose your country and comfortable language then a sign-in or sign-up page will pop up. if you don’t want to sign in, just skip that and go ahead. You will then land on the product page where you can select unique products as per gender, like jeans, trousers, jackets, shoes, etc. There are so many other products and if you click any of them you can see the description and other details about that particular product. If you want to buy it you can add it to the “Cart” or you can directly buy it, after that you can select your payment options either you can select online payment or  cash on delivery. If you select online payment you have the options of credit or debit card, pay by phone pay, Google Pay, PayPal etc.
